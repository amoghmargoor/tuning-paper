\subsection{Current State of Statistics and Join Reordering Algorithm for Big Data}

Currently, all these engines either use the Hive statistics or have statistics similar to it \cite{b1}:
\begin{itemize}
\item totalSize: Total size of the dataset as its seen at the filesystem level.
\item numFiles: Number of files the dataset consists of.
\item rawDataSize: Uncompressed size of the dataset.
\item numRows: Number of rows in the dataset.
\item columnStatistics: Statistics at column level: number of distinct values, max value, min value, number of null values, max length, average length.
\end{itemize}
