\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We discussed the commonly used Join algorithm in Big Data Engines and benefits of Join Reordering for them. Then we looked into how traditional approaches fail in Big Data paradigm. This motivated us to propose a novel algorithm that can be used in Big Data Engines where statistics are scarce. We evaluated this technique on widely popular TPC-DS benchmark to observe it's benefit. The focus of the work was to study the benefits of a simpler technique in scenario where more sophisticated techniques failed in Big Data paradigm. As a future work:

\begin{itemize}
\item Continue to identify and handle more query patterns for Reordering.
\item Eliminate regressions of any kind due to this.
\item Integrate this approach more tightly with Adaptive Execution to atleast obtain more accurate sizes of the plan.
\end{itemize}
